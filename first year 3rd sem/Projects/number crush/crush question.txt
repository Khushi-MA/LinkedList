Nancy plays a numbers crush game in her leisure time. She follows a certain pattern to crush the numbers.
She has a number with her in the beginning.
She checks with the next number she gets.
If both the numbers are same she crushes both the numbers.
If Nancy has more numbers with her, she checks the next number with the most recent number she has.
If again the numbers are same, she crushes both the numbers.
At any point of time, if both the numbers are not same, she keeps the next number with her and continues checking.
If Nancy is able to crush all the numbers, then she proceeds to next level to crush next set of numbers.
If she is not able to crush all the numbers, she shows the remaining numbers.
Apply PSF and write modular C program to help Nancy to proceed to next level.

Input Format
First line is N – numbers with Nancy. Second line is the set of numbers

Constraints
N should be more than 1, so that Nancy can check to crush them. Numbers should be positive

Output Format
Display “Proceed to next level” if Nancy is able to crush all the numbers. Otherwise display the numbers she was not able to crush.

10

Explanation 0
First number Nancy has is 10 in the beginning.
She checks with next incoming number 20, both are not same, she keeps the numbers.
Nancy has 10 20. Next number is 10 in the sequence, recent number she has is 20,
checks both the numbers, they are not same, she keeps the numbers. Nancy has 10 20 10.
Next number is 10 in the sequence is same as recent number 10, she crushes both the numbers.
Now Nancy is left with 10 20. Next number is 20 in the sequence is same as recent number 20,
she crushes both the numbers. Now Nancy is left with 10.
Next number is 20 in the sequence is not same as recent number 10, she keeps the number.
Now Nancy is left with 10 20.
Next number is 30 in the sequence is not same as recent number 20, she keeps the number.
Now Nancy is left with 10 20 30.She shows the left out numbers as: 30 20 10

Explanation 1

Explanation: Nancy has 12 in the beginning, checks with next number 14, both are not same, she keeps the numbers.
Nancy has 12 14. Next number is 14, and Nancy has recent number 14.
Both are same numbers, she crushes them. Nancy is left with 12.
Next number is 12, she has recent number 12 with her. Both are same, therefore she crushes them.
There are no further numbers to checks and Nancy also does not have any numbers with her, she proceeds to next level.
